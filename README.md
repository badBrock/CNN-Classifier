# ECG Classification Using CNN

This project focuses on classifying ECG (Electrocardiogram) signals using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model is trained to detect different types of heartbeats from preprocessed ECG data, such as those from the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Dataset.

## ðŸ”— Access the Code in Google Colab

You can open and run the complete code in Google Colab using the link below:

ðŸ‘‰ [Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Gu3oAHmUBZdUdcbaF79J5sYLpKcbezFO#scrollTo=0ra3W_psPFiT)

## ðŸ“Š Features

- CNN model for ECG classification
- Train/validation loss and accuracy visualization (with Plotly)
- Confusion matrix visualization (with Plotly)
- Classification metrics (precision, recall, F1-score)
- Support for class imbalance handling

## ðŸ§° Requirements

This project runs entirely in Google Colab, so no local installation is needed. Required libraries include:

- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Plotly
- Pandas

All necessary installations are handled within the notebook.

## ðŸ“ˆ Example Visualizations

- Training/validation accuracy and loss curves
- Interactive confusion matrix
- Classification report with precision, recall, and F1-score

## ðŸ§ª How to Use

1. Click the Colab link above.
2. Run each cell step by step (Shift + Enter).
3. Modify the code or parameters as needed for experimentation.
